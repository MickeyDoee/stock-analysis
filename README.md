# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this Project was to see the total return of every Ticker. When calculating the average we can see the daily return of each ticker that could be positive or negative. Only two out of twelve tickers were actually positive return through their daily volume.

## Results

### Only two out of twelve Tickers were successful in their total daily volume return. ENPH and RUN were the most successful.

### With such a high poop return rate, only four tickers returns <-10% back from their daily volume. Something to notice is that these four did not bring in as much daily volume linking it to potentially being tickers with a lower/ newer potential.

### DQ had the worst return rate of -62.6% with JKS being a close 2nd of -60.5%. 

## Summary

- One disadvantage to refactoring code was the density of having to re-collaborate all of the same but different code. I had to go back and re-think of the code that was not being able to run due to similarities in the code. Advantages is that I was able to identify where I could tighten up in my coding and really maximize my line of code.
- The original line of code was more simplistic and once receiving the new line of code I realised I had more lines that I needed to be modifying. It was more consitrated but I had trouble trying to wrap my head around the new code.
